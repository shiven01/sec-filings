Big Money Moves – Transactions over $1 million are a strong signal. If an insider is making a large purchase, they likely have confidence in the company’s future.

Multiple Directors Buying – If several executives or board members are buying at the same time, it’s a huge green flag. This suggests they see strong upside and aren’t acting alone.

Buys, Not Sells – While insiders sell for many reasons (taxes, diversification, etc.), they only buy for one reason—they think the stock will go up.

Recent Trends – Look at the company’s past insider transactions. Is this a one-off buy, or has there been a pattern of accumulation?

"Insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise"
